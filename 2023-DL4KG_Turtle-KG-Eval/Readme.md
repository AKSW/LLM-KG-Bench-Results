# Results of LLM-KG-Bench runs for DL4KG@ISWC 2023

Results and log of [LLM-KG-Bench](https://github.com/AKSW/LLM-KG-Bench) runs described in article for Submission "Benchmarking the Abilities of Large Language Models for RDF Knowledge Graph Creation and Comprehension: How Well Do LLMs Speak Turtle?", Frey et al. to [Workshop DL4KG@ISWC 2023](https://alammehwish.github.io/dl4kg2023/)

We collected data in multiple runs, each resulting in files with date and time of experiment start in filename:
* result files (`.json`, `.txt`, `.yaml`, same info in different serializations) containing task, response and evaluation data
* model log files (`.jsonnl` in directory `modelLog`) containing details on LLM interaction
* full log files (`.log` in directory `log`) containing debug log for runs
