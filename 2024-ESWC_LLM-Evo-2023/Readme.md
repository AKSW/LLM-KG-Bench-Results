# Results of LLM-KG-Bench runs for ESWC 2024

Results and log of [LLM-KG-Bench](https://github.com/AKSW/LLM-KG-Bench) runs described in article "Evaluating the Performance Evolution of LLMs in Knowledge Graph Engineering with LLM-KG-Bench", Frey et al. to [ESWC 2024](https://2024.eswc-conferences.org)

We collected data in multiple runs, each resulting in files with date and time of experiment start in filename:
* result files `(`.json`, `.txt`, `.yaml`, same info in different serializations) containing task, response and evaluation data
* model log files (`.jsonl`) containing details on LLM interaction
* full debug-log files (`.log`) containing debug log for runs

Folder [Q3vsQ4](Q3vsQ4/) contains the result files used for the comparisson of Q3 and Q4 results.
